# Te Whatu Ora on GitHub

This GitHub Pages root site was first created in order to add a `/robots.txt` file for the [FHIR Questionnaire proof-of-concept](https://tewhatuora.github.io/fhir-fe-poc-pages/).

It has subsequently been extended with a list of some of our notable open source projects:

- [URL to QR Code generator](./url-to-qr-svg/) (Source: [`url-to-qr-svg`](https://github.com/tewhatuora/url-to-qr-svg/))
